            The Historical Background. The Road Transport Employer's Association
            of Nigeria (RTEAN) Niger State Branch commenced operations in Niger
            State in 1982,under the leadership of a transporter and a car dealer
            Alhaji Muhammadu Etsu Gwari who is the pioneer chairman of RTEAN
            Niger State. His most remarkable legacies in his six year
            administration between (1982- 1989) were the spreading and edifying
            the union,protection of it's invation, manipulation and domination
            from the sister's unions. He was the owner of the only Mercedes Benz
            three seater that was used for town services in Minna town services
            in Minna township. He served for six years. In 1990, Alhaji Baba
            Dogara Bida took over. Even though there was not proper structural
            administration, he created three zones for operation which were;
            Minna zone,Bida zone and Agaie zones (1990-1996). He served for six
            years. Alhaji Saba Naira Dabban took up the chairmanship in 1997, he
            campaigned and enlightened the people about joining RTEAN, he
            encouraged the youths to join RTEAN which he succeeded in luring
            thousands of youth into the association between (1997- 2015). He
            served for eighteen years. Alhaji Abdullahi Dikko Manu was nominated
            to pilot the affairs of RTEAN as the next state chairman
            between(2015-2019). During his incumbency as the state chairman, a
            memorandum of understanding was signed between the three sisters
            union; NURTW, RTEAN and NARTO under the supervision of the then
            state Governor, Governor Sani Bello Lolo. That is the three sisters
            union has equal rights to operate in all parks and garages within
            the state capital and across the twenty five local government areas
            of Niger State. It was then that RTEAN begins to spread their
            tentacles to other places that will favour them. He spent four year
            serving. Alhaji Alfa Agaie took over in 2017 for the period of six
            months which gave room for nomination of Alhaji Garba Sule Paiko as
            the new state chairman between (2018-2020). Some of the legacies
            recorded were the creation of few chapels in some areas of the

            during Covid 19 pandemic by the then Governor Sani Bello of Niger
            State where he ensured that enough food stuffs were distributed to
            RTEAN members. Upon leaving the office he was appointed as a special
            committee by the National President to go round various states to
            checkmate ticket, Manifest,Uniforms and ensuring proper election
